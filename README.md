This project involves creating a replica of the Amazon website’s frontend using only HTML and CSS. The goal is to simulate the visually familiar layout and user interface of Amazon’s homepage and some core pages. The clone replicates key sections such as the header with logo, search bar, navigation menus, sign-in options, cart icon, and language selectors.
<br>
The main content area includes components like promotional banners or hero sections, product category cards, featured products displayed in grids or horizontal scroll lists, and a detailed footer with links to help, policies, and company info.
<br>
Using HTML semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and appropriate <div> containers structures the webpage meaningfully. CSS is then employed to style these elements with colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsiveness resembling the Amazon site.
<br>
Common CSS techniques include flexbox or grid for layout, styled input fields for the search bar, hover states on buttons and links, and media queries to make the page responsive on various screen sizes.
